# Pairs - Memory Game

In this project, I'll be creating a single-player version of a classic family card game that we all loved when we were children. It's suitable for players of all ages as all it requires is the ability to memorise. 


## Things to remember:

- The selection of cards need to be shuffled and flipped upside-down so the player cannot see the images on the cards. 
- The player needs to select two of the cards to turn them over to check if they match. If the cards match, the player earns 2 points and those cards remain facing up. 
- If the player selects two cards that do not match, the cards will be turned back around and that turn would end. 
- The aim of the game is to have all the cards flipped right-side up. 

## Tech Stack

For this project I am using:
